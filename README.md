Declaration
of Academic Honesty1
I declare on my honour that what is written in this work has been written exclusively by me and that,
excluding quotations, no part has been copied from scientific publications, Internet (any type of programs,
set of tools and others included) or research works - or, more generally, any other source - already
presented in the academic field (but not only) by me, other students or third parties.
In the case of parts taken from scientific publications, the Internet or any other document, I have
expressly and directly indicated the source at the end of the quotation or at the foot of the page as well
as having duly marked them in the text by quotation marks where indicated verbatim.
I also declare that I have taken note of the sanctions with regards to plagiarism and any other illicit
behavior as provided for in the current Study Regulations as well as described in Academic Integrity, a
mandatory on-line test designed to prevent any instances of student misconduct (among others:
plagiarism, cheating, collusion, fabrication/falsification and personation) according to Art. 28 para. 6 and
41 para. 1 of the Study Regulations.
In the case of work written by several students - where this is allowed and/or provided for - I have also
clearly and unequivocally indicated which student has written each part.
